Above I have listed documented some trade-offs and I will explain the reasoning behind them.

- Online presence
  - This is mandatory and should be achievable given that I am a Front-End Web Developer(the course upto now has given everything I need to achieve this).

- Produce Range
  - Not as important as an online presence, but most definitely still up there. I feel it is also feasible given my skillset

- Social media interaction
  - Again, this is well within my skillset as this could be something as simple as a CTA or footer icons with links to social media. had a massive issue with that website doesnt responfd and lost several times my project due to new website use.

- Click & Collect
  - In order to get a click & collect system similar(Just-Eat) to other sites I would need to expand my knowledge.This isn't something I feel I have the knowledge for at the moment, so the feasiblity for it scores a one. However, this doesn't mean that it won't be implemented in future updates.

  *Note: Upon looking at the logistics of the click & collect system I realised that it doesn't necessarily have to be as complicated as Just-Eat. Customers can use the contact form to essentially order from the menu. 

- Email marketing
  - This could involve a signup form and database of customer emails. There is technology that would handle this for me however I don't feel I have the time or knowledge to implement this.
